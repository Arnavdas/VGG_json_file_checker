# VGG_json_file_operations


This is a script to check the json annotation files(specifically no of objects tagged and also to check if you have left any annotated area unnamed) if you are using VGG image annotator(https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/) and have selected 'polygon region shape' as the annotation shape to annotate the objects

Put this up here because I use this scripts while annotating extensively.
