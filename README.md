# VGG_json_file_operations


This set of scripts are for performing different operations on json annotation files, iff you are using VGG image annotator(https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/) and have selected 'polygon region shape' as the annotation shape to annotate the objects.

Put this up here because I use these scripts while annotating extensively.
